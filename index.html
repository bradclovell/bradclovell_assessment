        <h1>Dear Hiring Committee</h1>
        <p>
          At right is my submission for the coding assessment portion of the interview process. I will explain its functionality:
        </p>
        <p>
          The above search bar will accept any term that appears as a medical reaction in an FDA-reported adverse drug event (e.g. depression, pain, alopecia, death).
          The initial display shows results for headache.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wordcloud in the center shows some of the most common reactions that appear along with the search term, with sizes related to the frequency of their co-occurrence.
          Each reaction is colored according to its seriousness, defined as the ratio of events flagged as "serious" to total events that include that reaction,
          with redder colors for more serious events and bluer colors for fewer, with white representing an equal number of serious and non-serious events containing the reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top bar graph shows the same data, but in a more explicitly structured manner, with the bars colored instead of the reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bar graph shows a list of the most common drugs reported in the events containing the searched reaction.
          Note that while these drugs were part of the same reported drug reaction event, the FDA does not require a causal relationship to be established, and most events list multiple drugs.
          For example, aspirin appears near the top of many graphs, but it may be another drug in the reported events
          - or even the underlying condition for which it was prescribed - that is causing the observed reaction.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Technical Details
        </h1>
        <p>
          This webpage contains code to create customizable queries to the FDA's Drug API Adverse Events Endpoint.
          Once a search term is entered, it submits a query to find the most commonly co-occurring reactions.
          After ignoring the first result (the reaction itself), it submits a query for each of the top 20 co-reactions
          to see how many events containing the given reaction were flagged as serious and how many were flagged as non-serious.
          After the callback function for these queries is called for the final time, the wordcloud and top graph are drawn.
          In parallel with the first query, another query is sent to determine the 20 drugs that appear most frequently in
          events containing the searched reaction, and the lower graph is then drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data are interpreted and processed in code, and their graphs are rendered using the D3.js library,
          with Jason Davies' d3-cloud addition for the wordcloud.
        </p>
