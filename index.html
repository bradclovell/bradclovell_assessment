          At right is my submission for the coding assessment portion of the interview process. I will explain its functionality:

          The above search bar will accept any term that appears as a medical reaction in an FDA-reported adverse drug event (e.g. depression, pain, alopecia, death).
          The initial display shows results for headache.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wordcloud in the center shows some of the most common reactions that appear along with the search term, with sizes related to the frequency of their co-occurrence.
          Each reaction is colored according to its seriousness, defined as the ratio of events flagged as "serious" to total events that include that reaction,
          with red colors for more serious events and blue colors for fewer, with white representing an equal number of serious and non-serious events containing the reaction.
        </p>
